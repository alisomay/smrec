# smrec

Minimalist multi-track audio recorder which may be controlled via OSC or MIDI

An introduction comes here..

Now let's record some sound! üîî

## Usage

Coming soon.. probably tomorrow.
I'd not use it if I were you, it's not ready yet.
It works but it would be better with a doc, just wait a little and it will be here, I'm tired today :).

## Next steps

Probably run, you'll get it when I write the intro.
